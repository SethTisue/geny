/**
 * A [[Writable]] is a source of bytes that can be written to an OutputStream.
 *
 * Essentially a push-based version of `java.io.InputStream`, that allows an
 * implementation to guarantee that cleanup logic runs after the bytes are
 * written.
 *
 * [[Writable]] is also much easier to implement than `java.io.InputStream`: any
 * code that previously wrote output to an `ByteArrayOutputStream` or
 * `StringBuilder` can trivially satisfy the [[Writable]] interface. That makes
 * [[Writable]] very convenient to use for allowing zero-friction zero-overhead
 * streaming data exchange between different libraries.
 *
 * [[Writable]] comes with implicit constructors from `Array[Byte]`, `String`
 * and `InputStream`, and is itself a tiny interface with minimal functionality.
 * Libraries using [[Writable]] are expected to extend it to provide additional
 * methods or additional implicit constructors that make sense in their context.
